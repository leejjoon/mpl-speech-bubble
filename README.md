# mpl-speech-bubble

A proof-of-concept package to draw speech bubble. It is basically MPL's
annotation but tt meges the arrow patch and bbox patch using `skia-pathops`. The
package is far from complete and only recommended for an advanced MPL user who
are well familiar with how annotation works.

## Installation

The package is not available at pip. You can clone the git repository and
install from the source.:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Development Installation


```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
